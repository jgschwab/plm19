1d. Give a small example of using LISP hash tables to (1) crete a
hash table then (2) write something into that hash table then (3)
read that value back.

>   (defparameter dict '((foo . 1) (bar . 2)))  ;define hash table data
--> DICT   ;hash table name returned
>   (cdr(assoc 'foo dict))                      ;get the value of the the key foo
--> 1      ;return value


1e What does the LISP "sublis" function do? Give
an example..

sublis is a bit like 'find-and-replace' for lisp structures (linked cons cells).
It takes as parameters an association list (a list of key-value pairs) and a
lisp structure to perform the replacements in. Any keys in the parameterized
association list that are found in the parameterized lisp structure are replaced
with the value for the corresponding key in the former. For example:

>   (sublis '((foo . 42) (bar . 69)) '(myfunc foo bar))
--> (MYFUNC 42 69)


1f. In Prolog, what is the role of the bindings variable "binds".

It binds a value to a variable. Binding is used often when determining
truth of a query, where there is a variable in a rule for which a
value has not been found that satisfies the rule. When a value is
indeed found, it is bound to the variable.

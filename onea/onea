% TASK
% Write human-readable rules to manage these facts.

:- dynamic fact/3. % can be retracted/asserted at runtime
fact(emp,tim,      [job=cleaner,mother=president]).
fact(emp,jane,     [job=president]).
fact(job,cleaner,  [salary=10000]).
fact(job,professor,[salary=30000]).

% for example, let me show you how i got this job
%
% rule nepotism 
% if   
%      emp = E had job=J had mother in [president,chancellor] and
%      job = J had salary =< 10000 and
%      job = J2 had salary > 20000
% then
%      emp =E has job = J2.
% %

% To achieve this task, take 6 small steps
% If it works, you should be able to load the code with zero
% load-time errors and all the testN predicates working without
% getting "failed(X)" errors
